    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a language for describing web pages.
         HTML is a markup language rather than a programming language and makes use of HTML tags 
         to structure the content of your web pages.

        Is there a difference between HTML and XHTML? XHTML is more choosy than HTML in that there 
        are some elements that absolutely must appear in the XHTML markup, but which may be omitted if youâ€™re 
        using HTML 4 and earlier versions. If you would like more information on these differences see:</p>

        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        <p>HTML tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets like  and normally come in pairs 
            . The first tag of the pair is the opening or start tag, the next one the closing or end tag.</p>

            <h3>The History of HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. 
                It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

                Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to 
                jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. 
                The latest version is known as HTML5.
                
                A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to
                 control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things:
                  tags and attributes.
